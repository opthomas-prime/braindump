## Introduction
I'm getting older - and i keep forgetting stuff.
I'm not talking about contact data, user credentials, technical documentations and such things.
There are well-known tools to store such information in a sorted/organized manner.
I talk about undefined/unstructured information.
My workmate always keeps one plain text file in his favorite editor opened to store such arbitrary information and uses it's search mechanism to lookup things.
I wanted that too, but in a slightly more 'structured' fashion.
So i built this little tool to accomplish this...

tl;dr: Helps to remember stuff that wont fit in any scheme.

## Disclaimer
- Read `README.md`. If anything in this Repository bricks your PC - not my fault!

## Dependencies
- Python 3 (build and tested with 3.6.0)
- Whoosh - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Whoosh (build and tested with 2.7.4):
    - `sudo pip3 install whoosh`

## Installation
- It's one single script. Place it where you want.
- If you don't know what to do:
    - Copy `braindump.py` to a place where your `$PATH` points to (e.g. `sudo cp braindump.py /usr/local/bin/brian`).
    - Ensure the script is executable (`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/brian`)
- If you trust me and still don't know what to do (also installs Whoosh):

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opthomas-prime/braindump/master/setup.sh | sh
```
