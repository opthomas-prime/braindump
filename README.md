## Introduction
I'm getting older - and i keep forgetting stuff.
I'm not talking about contact data, user credentials, technical documentations and such things.
There are well-known tools to store such information in a sorted/organized manner.
I talk about undefined/unstructured information.
My workmate always keeps one plain text file in his favorite editor opened to store such arbitrary information and uses it's search mechanism to lookup things.
I wanted that too, but in a slightly more 'structured' fashion.
So i built this little tool to accomplish this...

tl;dr: Helps to remember stuff that wont fit in any scheme.
